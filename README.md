# ADB Remote Control

ADB Remote Control allows you to control your adb-connected device from your PC.
It enables clicks and drags with the mouse and normal keyboard inputs.

This project was inspired by [adbcontrol](http://marian.schedenig.name/2014/07/03/remote-control-your-android-phone-through-adb/)
and [Adb-Remote-Screen](https://github.com/MajeurAndroid/Adb-Remote-Screen), none of which were easy enough for me to
adapt to my needs.
